3D CAD and Print files (same models in several formats) for the 3D printing filament Dry Box described in my blog: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2023/12/diy-dry-box-for-3d-printing-filament.html

For a successful print the rollers must be printed vertically and with the 45 degrees bearing shoulder facing down. Instructions in the blog above.

The F3D Fusion 360 CAD files are the master files. The STEP files were used for 3D slicing & printing. All other file formats are derived from those (have not tested them all, so YMMV).

Happy build to all !
