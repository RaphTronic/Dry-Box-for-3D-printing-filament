3D CAD and Print files (same models in several formats) for 3D printing filament Dry Box described in my blog: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2023/08/diy-simple-spine-decompression-station.html

For a successful print the rollers must be printed vertically and with the 45 degrees bearing shoulder facing down. Instructions in the blog above.

The Sketchup model (SKP & DAE files) is the master the others are converted from (those were not checked, might have issues?).

Happy build to all !
