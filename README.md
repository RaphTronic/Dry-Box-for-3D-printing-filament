3D CAD and Print files (same models in several formats) for the **3D printing filament Dry Box** described in my blog: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2023/12/diy-dry-box-for-3d-printing-filament.html

The **F3D** Fusion 360 CAD files are the master files. The **STEP** files were used for 3D slicing & printing. All the other file formats were derived from those (have not tested them all, so YMMV).

Happy build to all !

Note: For a successful print the rollers must be printed vertically and with the 45 degrees bearing shoulder facing down. I.e. like the roller on the left, below, not like the one on the right. Indeed, the other shoulder is 90 degrees and won't print properly if facing down.
